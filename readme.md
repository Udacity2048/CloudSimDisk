#CLOUDSIMDISK: A framework For Energy-Aware Storage Simulation In CloudSim

##Introduction
CloudSimDisk is a scalable framework for modelling and simulation of power-aware hard disk drive in CloudSim.

##Description
See Javadoc.

##Release
The present project has been developed in 2015, released in May 2015.
The word has been publised at the 8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC), Cyprus.
CloudSimDisk will be your keyword to find anything about it (paper available on IEEE website).

##Conclusion
This work is a strong and flexible base for future developments.
I had hard times to make it, but now you can have fun time to play with it and improve it :)

Have fun!
